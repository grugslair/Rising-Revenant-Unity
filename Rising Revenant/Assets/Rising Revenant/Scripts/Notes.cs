/*
  
    UI:

    scripts and classes that will deal with the overall behaviour of each page is <PageName>PageBehaviour
    components are standalone UI entities always present such as minimap and such   <CompName>UiComponent
    Elements are things such as list elements or things that are added to comps or pages      <Page/Comp Name><Context>Element

    its ok for now to have all this events but they are for sure not necessary, alot of things are singular therefore not necessary
    to subscribe, just have a main public class for all the UI main scripts and use the on enalble and disable to switch them if necessary


both the trades page need more oopenisss
